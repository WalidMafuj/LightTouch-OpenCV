# LightTouch-OpenCV || Tech Tussle 2021
What if we could convert any ordinary display into a touch screen one using a useless smartphone camera.
we built this python script for you.

### HOW TO Run the program
- [x] Install python . [may follow any youtube]
- [x] Install "IP Cam" https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&hl=en in your smart phone.
- [x] Tap start server on your smartphone.
- [x] The app will provide you a IP link. Copy this link
- [x] Open Main.py script and Find for "url = "http://192.168.0.3:8080/shot.jpg" " & just replace the link only . for example your link is xxx.xxx.x.x then the link will be http://xxx.xxx.x.x:8080/shot.jpg
- [x] save the script. 
- [x] - [x] Run "Main.py" script and allow "connection" prompt.
####[[Note: if you want to run this script in background you can make it formless ".exe" by converting this Python script [.py file] into an Executable file [.exe file.] ]]

### Remote side
- [x] Install python
- [x] If you are using android then use "termux" app or anyother terminal emulator. then run this command "pkg install python"
- [x] Run "remote.py" by using this command "python remote.py" [Note: for linux or android devices use this command "cd [location of remote.py file]" to select the location of remote.py file. (eg. "cd /sdcard/download/remote.py")   ]
