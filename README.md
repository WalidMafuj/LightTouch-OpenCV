What if we could convert any ordinary display into a touch screen one using a useless smartphone camera.
we built this python script for you.

### HOW TO Run the program
- [x] Install python . [may follow any youtube]
- [x] Run the script and allow connection prompt.
- [ ] Note: if you want to run this script in background you can make it formless ".exe" by converting this Python script [.py file] into an Executable file [.exe file.]

### Remote side
- [x] Install python
- [x] If you are using android then use "termux" app or anyother terminal emulator. then run this command "pkg install python"
- [x] Run "remote.py" by using this command "python remote.py" [Note: for linux or android devices use this command "cd [location of remote.py file]" to select the location of remote.py file. (eg. "cd /sdcard/download/remote.py")   ]

## Thank You :)
